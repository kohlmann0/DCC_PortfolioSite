# Summary: #

This website was our final project at DevCodeCamp. 

We had one week to create a searchable Facebook/Linked-in style website for other students to share projects, and then present it to real local businesses as a practice 'Sales-demonstration'.

It turned out really well. We had a finished minimum-viable-product, demonstrated it to two companies, and learned a lot in such a short time. 

The worst/best feedback we got was that it needed some improved styling/color and larger/responsive buttons for the project profile carousel, and our "search engine" (or lack there-of) would need to be improved for a consumer product. But literally everyone stated they were amazed at our progress in only 5 days (150 man hours between the three team members). My responsibility on this particular project was the front-end portion (I typically do the back-end, so we decided to "stretch our abilities" on this one).

I guess that's what you get from 3 mid-career professionals, changing their direction (2 mechanical engineers and a professional realtor). Solid work ethic, problem solving skills, and a passion for learning on-the-go! :)


## Technical Details: ##

It was coded using .NET MVC (circa. 2015), and razor markup.
Bootstrap was used for it's responsive website controls.
It used Azure Blob Storage as the image repository and a locally hosted SQL server for user-roles/security and profile/project data.
It followed the standard MVC UI pattern.
Search as a very basic case insensitive word match.
